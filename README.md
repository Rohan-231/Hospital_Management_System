# Hospital Management System

## Overview

This project is a Java-based web application designed to manage hospital operations efficiently. The system is built using Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JDBC for database connectivity, with Apache Tomcat as the server. The backend database is MySQL. The application provides functionality for booking appointments, managing patient and doctor information, and includes portals for patients, doctors, and administrators.

## Features

- **Patient Portal**: Allows patients to register, log in, book appointments, and view their medical history.
- **Doctor Portal**: Enables doctors to log in, view appointments, and manage patient records.
- **Admin Portal**: Admin can manage doctor profiles, patient records, and oversee the overall system operations.
- **Appointment Booking**: Patients can book appointments with available doctors.
- **Record Management**: Admin can manage and maintain records of patients and doctors.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language used for the application.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: For connecting to and interacting with the MySQL database.
- **Java Servlets & JSP**: For handling server-side logic and rendering dynamic web pages.
- **Apache Tomcat**: Web server used to deploy and run the application.
- **MySQL**: Backend database for storing all application data, including patient and doctor records.


## Usage

- **Patient Access**: Patients can register and log in to book appointments and view their medical history.
- **Doctor Access**: Doctors can log in to view their scheduled appointments and manage patient records.
- **Admin Access**: Admins can log in to manage doctor profiles, view and edit patient records, and oversee system operations.

## Future Enhancements
